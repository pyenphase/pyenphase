# Data

The pyenphase package collects {py:class}`~pyenphase.EnvoyData` from a specific set of endpoints on the Envoy. The set is based on the home owner [authorization level](./usage_authentication.md#authorization-levels) as a common denominator. Additional endpoints [can be requested](./requests.md#requests), but require application logic.
